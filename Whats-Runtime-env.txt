- JavaScript is a language.
- It runs inside a runtime environment (browser or Node.js), powered by a JS engine.

🔹 Node.js as a Runtime Environment
- Node.js is not a language. It’s a runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine.

Def - A runtime is the place where your code actually runs and gets executed.

A JavaScript Runtime Environment is a system that -

    1.Executes JavaScript code
    2.Provides APIs that JS itself does not have
    3.Manages memory, events, and execution


4️⃣ Browser & Node.js — Why BOTH are Runtime Environments

Browser Runtime

Provided by:

Chrome
Firefox
Edge

It gives JS:

window
document
DOM
events
timers
Web APIs





JavaScript the language can ONLY do:

variables
functions
loops
logic

That’s it.

JavaScript CANNOT:
read files
show UI
access network
listen to clicks
open ports

👉 The runtime gives JS its powers.





Node.js Runtime

Provided by:
Node (V8 + C++ bindings)

It gives JS:

global
file system (fs)
networking (http)
OS access
process control

So JS can control servers.





Frontend JS:

reacts to clicks
manipulates DOM

Backend JS:

reacts to requests
manipulates data
returns responses

Same brain. Different job.





1️⃣ Brutal Truth (As promised)

If you don’t separate:

JavaScript (language)
Runtime environment

You will:

misuse globals
write insecure code
struggle with backend
Most beginners never make this distinction. You are ahead.
