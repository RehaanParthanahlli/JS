• JavaScript: One of the most popular and rapidly growing programming languages globally.
   - Front-end developer, Back-end developer, Full-stack developer: Career paths available when learning JavaScript.

• Browsers: The original and primary environment where JavaScript code was designed to run.

• JavaScript engine: The component within a browser (or Node) that executes JavaScript code.
  - V8: Google's open-source JavaScript engine, used in Chrome. 
  - SpiderMonkey: The JavaScript engine used in Firefox.

• Node.js: A C++ program created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 that embeds the V8 engine, allowing JavaScript code to run outside of a browser.

• Runtime Environment: What browsers and Node provide for JavaScript code execution.

• ECMAScript: The specification or standard that JavaScript, as a programming language, adheres to.

• ECMA: The organization responsible for defining and managing the ECMAScript standards.

• ES6 (ECMAScript 2015): A significant version of the specification released in 2015, which introduced many new features.

• Web or mobile apps / Real-time networking applications / Games: Examples of modern applications that can be built using JavaScript.

* ES6 is a version of the ECMAScript specification that defines the syntax and behavior of JavaScript.

I. JAVASCRIPT (Popular, fast-growing programming language)



• A. Definition & Career
    ◦ Is a Programming Language
    ◦ Conforms to the ECMAScript Specification
    ◦ Career Roles:
        ▪ Front-end Developer
        ▪ Back-end Developer
